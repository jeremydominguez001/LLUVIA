# The Guide to Surviving LLUVIA

## INTRODUCTION: What is LLUVIA?
LLUVIA is an arcade game that was carefully crafted to capture the old feel of arcade games with a dystopian edge. By carefully, I mean a lot of thought was put into the esthetic design of the arcade game, for what it's worth, to capture both the childhood arcade and dystopian feel (yes, even the frustrating bugs, LOL). Every color was changed like 100 times because it just felt off. All the artwork and design, and colors were made in illustrator and countless trial and error. The font was diligently selected from DaFonts.  

### Ok, I see the arcade-style, but what's up with the dystopian feel?
The game aims to carry the ongoing conversation of being conscientious about our environment. By burning fossil fuels to generate electricity, the use of oil refineries, manufacturing, and various other vehicles, a lot of the rainfall that we experience every day is indeed acidic –– i.e., Acid Rain. That's not even mentioning how acid rain seeps into lakes and streams.

The user's objective is to clean up these acidic raindrops in the post-apocalyptic environment by converting the acid rain into fresh, clean water to restoring the earth back to its flourishing state.


## Some More Information on Acid Rain
The ecological effects of acid rain arrive in multitudes in addition to its impact on our health. When sulfate and nitrate, a product of the pollutants of acid rain, is inhaled into our lungs, there lie adverse effects with our heart function –– like heart attacks leading to death, increase in heart disease, effects on lung function, and breathing difficulties for people with asthma.  If you wish to learn more about its effects on our ecosystem, here's a good link to start:

It is evident that we need a more sustainable solution to cleaning up our air and water. And it will be no easy task. 


## Starting the Application
To start the application, it is no different than any other python app.
That is, open a terminal in the same location as the main.py and type the following:
[installed/location/of/python3 main.py]

## Playing the game
The objective of LLUVIA is to essentially convert all of the acid raindrops into clean rainwater (Poland springs would be jealous) by not letting them hit the ground.
Once the acid drop is popped, then it will nourish the ground.

When it rains, it pours, so acid drops will keep on falling until the game is exited from or three acid drops pollute the ground. Once the game ends, the user will have to restart the game by means of closing the window and repeating the aforementioned step labeled "Starting the Application".
